# Metro-Hazard-Detection-
Implemented a Iot project on 'Underground Railroad Safety System'. In this project,  abnormal discrepancies like fire, gas leakage, sparks, high temperature, and humidity are being checked and alerted. Developed an Android application which fetches data from Firebase Realtime database and an alert notification system that sends alert texts from Nodemcu to Telegram.
